**Intermediary Project:**
> The _intermediary project_ for the Network Architectures course involves designing, implementing, and testing a network using Layer 3 and Layer 2 routing protocols. The task includes building and configuring a specific network topology, establishing IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity among network elements, configuring IPv4 and IPv6 routing paths, and implementing Layer-2 routing based on the Spanning Tree Protocol. Additional tasks include connecting an extra router and configuring it with RIP, and submitting a comprehensive report detailing the network configurations, connectivity proofs, and OSPFv2 database descriptions.
