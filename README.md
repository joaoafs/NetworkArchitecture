# NetworkArchitecture
@IST - AR Project

Project made with **[JoÃ£o Iria](https://github.com/JoaoIria)** and **[Leonor Ferreira](https://github.com/LeonorRFerreira)**

**Intermediary Project:**
> The _intermediary project_ for the Network Architectures course involves designing, implementing, and testing a network using Layer 3 and Layer 2 routing protocols. The task includes building and configuring a specific network topology, establishing IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity among network elements, configuring IPv4 and IPv6 routing paths, and implementing Layer-2 routing based on the Spanning Tree Protocol. Additional tasks include connecting an extra router and configuring it with RIP, and submitting a comprehensive report detailing the network configurations, connectivity proofs, and OSPFv2 database descriptions.

**Final Project:**
> The _final_ phase of the AR project involves implementing, configuring, and testing a network architecture to demonstrate knowledge of networking protocols and equipment configuration. The main task is to build and configure the network as depicted in the provided network architecture diagram, which includes routers (R), switches (Sw), and switch-routers (SwR). Key elements of the project involve addressing, AS49 configuration, configurations for other Autonomous Systems (ASes), routing protocols, DNS and IPv6 connectivity, and additional configurations like unnumbered serial interfaces and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). The project requires careful attention to detail in setting up IPv4 and IPv6 networks, BGP and OSPF routing, and DNS server configuration, ensuring all network elements can communicate effectively.
